/// The example here is similar to the `PrepareDocumentForContainedSignatureExample` example, only here we are preparing a
/// different signature type that will be written into the document during the embed phase (`EmebedContainedPadesSignatureExample`).
/// We are specifying the PDF advanced digital signature type "PAdES". This translates to the signature `SubFilter` value of
/// "ETSI.CAdES.detached" in the PDF.
///
/// Currently, we cannot write this signature type in the PDF, so this type can only work with "Contained" signatures, where the signature field is
/// prepared first and a valid PAdES signature is inserted into the `Contents` entry of the PDF signature dictionary.

/// Please refer to the ETSI standard for more information on PAdES signatures in PDF:
